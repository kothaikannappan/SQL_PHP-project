The Halifax Science Library (HSL) maintains an SQL database containing tables about various publications.
HSL now has the following immediate plans:
a. to sell library items and record information about these sales (transactions) in their database;
b. to record, for each scientific journal (magazine), data about all articles in that magazine;
c. to record data about monthly expenses.
